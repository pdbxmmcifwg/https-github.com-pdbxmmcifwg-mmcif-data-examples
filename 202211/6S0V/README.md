The ZIP file Data_1_autoPROC_STARANISO_all.cif.zip contains the PDBx/mmCIF file Data_1_autoPROC_STARANISO_all.cif (68 Mb) with 5 data blocks:

* 1_staraniso: merged and scaled data post-processed by STARANISO for conversion from intensities to structure factor amplitudes and anomalous data.
* 1_staraniso_early: merged and scaled EARLY (potentially least radiation-damaged) data post-processed by STARANISO for conversion from intensities to structure factor amplitudes - useful for radiation-damage detection/description maps (as e.g. done in BUSTER).
* 1_staraniso_late: merged and scaled LATE (potentially most radiation-damaged) data post-processed by STARANISO for conversion from intensities to structure factor amplitudes - useful for radiation-damage detection/description maps (as e.g. done in BUSTER).
* 1_scaled_merged_intensities_AIMLESS: merged and scaled data from AIMLESS without any post-processing and/or data cut-off.
