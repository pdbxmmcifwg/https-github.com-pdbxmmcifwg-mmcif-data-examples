Example [PDBx/mmCIF](https://mmcif.wwpdb.org/pdbx-mmcif-home-page.html) files to highlight extensions to unmerged data (especially related to detector definitions provided through the [imgCIF/CBF Extension Dictionary](https://github.com/COMCIFS/imgCIF).

MX rotation examples:
- X-Ray diffraction data for [6S0V](6S0V) (see also [Mrugala et al (2021)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.15462) and [PDB](http://doi.org/10.2210/pdb6S0V/pdb)), reprocessed with [autoPROC](https://www.globalphasing.com/autoproc/) uysing [XDS (Kabsch, 2010](https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?dz5179) and [AIMLESS, Evans & Murshudov 2013](https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?ba5190). This is a 2-sweep dataset, collected on the same crystal but with different crystal-detector distance settings.

MX serial examples:
- Unmerged reflections are provided as an example from an XFEL dataset collected on thermolysin crystals in Feb 2013, as part of LCLS experiment L785.  Raw CSPAD images were processed using cctbx.xfel/DIALS as described in [Brewster 2019](http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?S2059798318009191) and deposited as [cxi.db entry 81](https://www.cxidb.org/id-81.html), including integrated intensities for each image.  These intensities were then scaled and post-refined by the program cctbx.xfel.merge, then saved as unmerged data in DIALS format.  They were then converted to mmCIF format and deposited in [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7352800).
